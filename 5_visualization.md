## Description

Generates interactive charts and textual summaries.

## Pseudocode

```python
# Import necessary libraries (e.g., Plotly)
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# TEST: Check if necessary libraries are imported correctly

def generate_visualizations(trade_performance, activity_summary, committee_correlations):
    """
    Generates interactive charts and textual summaries.
    """
    # Create a line chart of stock price with trade dates
    price_chart = create_price_chart(trade_performance)

    # TEST: Check if the price chart is created correctly

    # Create bar charts of trade counts
    trade_count_chart = create_trade_count_chart(activity_summary)

    # TEST: Check if the trade count chart is created correctly

    # Create a table of committee correlations
    committee_table = create_committee_table(committee_correlations)

    # Generate textual summaries
    textual_summary = generate_textual_summary(trade_performance, activity_summary, committee_correlations)
