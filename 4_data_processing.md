## Description

Analyzes the data, computes metrics, and identifies correlations.

## Pseudocode

```python
# Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas)
import pandas as pd

# TEST: Check if necessary libraries are imported correctly

def analyze_trades(trades, stock_prices):
    """
    Analyzes the trade data and computes relevant metrics.
    """
    # Calculate trade timing vs. performance
    trade_performance = calculate_trade_performance(trades, stock_prices)

    # TEST: Check if trade performance is calculated correctly

    # Summarize activity by person and ticker
    activity_summary = summarize_activity(trades)

    # TEST: Check if activity summary is generated correctly

    # Identify committee correlations
    committee_correlations = identify_committee_correlations(trades)

    # TEST: Check if committee correlations are identified correctly

    # Return the analysis results
    return trade_performance, activity_summary, committee_correlations

def calculate_trade_performance(trades, stock_prices):
    """
    Calculates the performance of each trade.
    """
    # For each trade, find the corresponding stock price at the time of the trade
    # Calculate the return after a certain period (e.g., 1 week, 1 month)
    # Placeholder for trade performance calculation logic

    # TEST: Check if trade performance is calculated (placeholder test)

    Summarizes trade activity by person and ticker.
    """
    # Count the number of trades by person and by ticker
    # Placeholder for activity summary logic
    activity_summary = {}  # Placeholder

    # TEST: Check if activity summary is generated (placeholder test)

def identify_committee_correlations(trades):
    """
    Identifies correlations between committee assignments and traded sectors.
    """

    # Identify matches (e.g., member on Agriculture Committee trading Agri stocks)

    return committee_correlations
