## Description

Processes user queries, reformulates them, and identifies the intent.

## Pseudocode

```python
# Import necessary libraries (e.g., for AI prompt engineering)
# Placeholder for library imports

# TEST: Check if necessary libraries are imported correctly

def process_query(user_query):
    """
    Processes the user query, reformulates it, and identifies the intent.
    """
    # Rephrase the query using AI prompt engineering
    rephrased_query = rephrase_query(user_query)

    # TEST: Check if the query is rephrased correctly

    # Identify the intent of the query (e.g., ticker symbol, legislator name, date range)
    query_intent = identify_intent(rephrased_query)

    # TEST: Check if the intent is identified correctly

    # Return the rephrased query and the query intent
    return rephrased_query, query_intent

def rephrase_query(user_query):
    """
    Rephrases the user query using AI prompt engineering.
    """
    # Use an AI prompt to rephrase the query
    # Example prompt: "Rephrase and clarify this question: {user_query}"
    # Placeholder for AI prompt engineering logic
    rephrased_query = "Rephrased: " + user_query  # Placeholder

    # TEST: Check if the query is rephrased (placeholder test)
    return rephrased_query

def identify_intent(rephrased_query):
    """
    Identifies the intent of the query (e.g., ticker symbol, legislator name, date range).
    """
    # Use natural language processing techniques to identify the intent
    # Placeholder for NLP logic
    query_intent = {"ticker": "AAPL", "legislator": None, "date_range": None}  # Placeholder

    # TEST: Check if the intent is identified (placeholder test)
    return query_intent
